    "    Finding sources of alternative energy is incredibly important as fossil fuel supplies dwindle. Piezoelectric devices can be used for “harvesting the vibrational energy of roads and walkways due to traffic, can produce electrical energy that is predictable (based on traffic patterns), and locally storable” (Stanford).  Our intention in using the datasets listed above is to locate the streets with the highest traffic volume, as this information can be used to help determine what areas of road are going to be the most valuable energy collecting locations.   \n",
    "    To put this into context, as part of a pilot program approved by the California Energy Commission (CEC), several California highways will be covered in piezoelectric crystals that will turn vibrations into electricity.  This technology can capture a portion of the energy resulting from the friction between the car and the road.  The materials needed to cover a kilometer of a two-lane street will cost approximately $405,253, so we intend to find the areas which are most heavily traveled, and calculate the efficiency of implementing this onto that area (Stanford).  The Stanford study also reveals that each car traveling on this 1-km strip will generate .19 MJ which will save $0.0064, saving about one twentieth of the cost of gasoline on this strip (estimated $0.124).  The street used in this study was projected to generate a revenue of $33,565 a year, meaning it would take 12 years to offset the original cost of implementation.  In addition, other studies estimate that the energy generated from a 10 mile stretch of four-lane roadway can power the entire city of Burbank, which has a population numbering 105,000 people (ZME Science). A case study in Israel revealed that a one kilometer stretch of a single and four lane road integrated with piezoelectricity generated 200 KWh for the single lane and one MWh on four lanes (Charif & Kour).  Using these pieces of information, we can calculate whether or not such a project would be profitable.  \n",
    "    We are specifically using San Diego’s datasets because California is the car capital of the world; therefore, with this greater volume of cars, we are more likely to find areas where the energy generated by all the cars will offset the costs.  Our hypothesis states our prediction that there are areas in San Diego where these piezoelectric energy generators would be efficient, largely due to the high traffic volume.  Other factors which may affect piezoelectric road efficiency are vehicle speed and vehicle weight, which is something we will want to keep in mind as we are studying data from both surface streets and highways.  Implementation also needs to be considered as past implementations of these crystals have laid out long stretches (> 1km) of the piezoelectric generators, which may be more difficult to implement on surface streets.  In summary, two of the main pieces of information that we can use in our project are that 1 car traveling over a 1-km strip will generate the energy equivalent to $0.0064 and the cost of implementing this 1-km strip will be $405,253.  Traffic data can then be used to estimate which areas will be most profitable, and just how profitable they will be.\n",

    "    After cleaning the data, our group will create a Python dictionary which maps each street in the San Diego county to the total traffic volume on that street. The dictionary treats each street as an individual road; for example, if a road has an intersection, it would be counted as two individual streets. Then, we’ll create another dictionary that maps intersections pairs to the total traffic volume through that intersection only. Then, using our two constructed dictionaries, we will sort the roads/intersections by total traffic volume to determine the optimal locations to place our piezoelectric sensors. After gathering a list of optimal sensor placement, we can take the average speed on roads and the average weight of a vehicle to determine the energy that will be generated from our sensors (accounting for error).\n",
    "    Another dictionary that we will create contains traffic information of highways with direction and segment data. From a previous study, we know that when a vehicle moves slowly, it actually generates slightly more energy than when it is moving quickly. Therefore, we will focus more on local streets -- not highways -- for realistic reasons, such as the fact that it’s harder to detour on highways and higher speed doesn’t generate more energy. The same analysis (sorting, avg speed / avg weight) will apply to highway data.\n",
    "    Lastly, we will create scatterplots based off of the Pearson correlation between traffic volume and the energy generated. This will allow us to visualize the data and present our findings in visual form. Visualization will also allow us to perform any transformations to the plots to find a functional relationship between data fields.\n",

    "    We have several possible pitfalls for our data. The largest problem comes from the fact that we are dependent on an algorithm to create our second dictionary, the intersection data set. Our project aims to construct this dictionary based on an algorithm that abstracts roads into graphs and computes traffic volumes within these smaller segments. However, if the algorithm that we’re using does not successfully compile our data, we will be less confident in the optimality of the placement of our sensors (not considering the intersections).\n",
    "\tIn addition, possible faults with data collection or the actual piezoelectric roads may interfere with our project. For example, broken stoplights, sporadic days with high population, or periods where the sensors malfunction all cause potential complications and biases within the data. Lastly, several problems may affect our conclusions; specifically, we only have approximations of the piezoelectric road costs, and analyzing particular segments of roads is difficult.\n",
    "\tIn the case that our methods don’t work, we will do our best to simply report any correlations that are found between traffic volumes, energy production, and funding saved using the sensors, as well as a list of optimal locations to place our sensors. Lastly, we will report all traffic flow volumes sorted by density and energy costs per square foot.\n"
